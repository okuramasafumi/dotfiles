# This is okuramasafumi's dotfiles
## Tools I use (mainly, daily)
- zsh
- vim
- tmux
## Future plan
These files are quite basic ones (although my vimrc is a bit long), and I want to add new dotfiles or improve exsiting ones, anytime I can.
Things I want to do especially soon are:
- add LICENSE
- add install script (sh or rake?)
